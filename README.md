# Python Projects
This project will contain Python misc projects with solutions

A lot of these projects will be from https://github.com/karan/Projects or other similar sources

Projects added so far:

**Collatz Conjecture** - Start with a number n > 1. Find the number of steps it takes to reach one using the following process: If n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

**Sorting** - Implement two types of sorting algorithms: Merge sort and Bubble sort.

**Find Pi** - Enter a number of itterations and have the program generate Pi as accurately as possible using well known algorithms. Spigot and Ramanujan's formulas are used in the solutions.
